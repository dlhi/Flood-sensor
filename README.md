# Flood-sensor
  This Lamppost Flood Detector project consists a flood detector unit and access point to alert user.
  The flood detector unit contains an Arduino, a HC-12 Transceiver, an antenna, a solar controller, and a solar panel. This unit measures floodwater in 6 inch increments and detects water presence by using steel conducting probes. 
  Once a probe is immersed in water, the unit will alert the access point. Each probe is preprogrammed to a specific digital pin on the Arduino. The unit sends the highest immersed probe height and the unitâ€™s specific coordinate.
  The access point is powered by and connected to the user's computer. The Flood Detector Application should be running which is a GUI that displays the status of the flood detector unit. If a flood is detected, the GUI will sound an alarm, change its green light to red, and the data will be recorded into a text file on the user's computer. If there is no user around, the alarm will continue to sound until a user turns it off to ensure the flood has been noticed. 
  When the flood recedes, the GUI will revert back to normal.
